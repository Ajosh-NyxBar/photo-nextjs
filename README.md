# Here My Next.js Project

Welcome to my Next.js project! This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and leverages various modern web technologies to create a dynamic and responsive web application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
